## 🏢 Admincity's Land Control

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity>)

Built on eon 1261 by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers>)

A tall building, located at the heart of _Admincity_. This building controls and governs a humongous area of land called “The land of A”.

This tall tower-like structure is beside a large grey cliff. The tower itself is built across multiple stories with many stairs and no other way to go up. There are no elevators or ladders, only steep stairs that make climbing this place a nightmare.

The purpose of this company is to defend and protect these lands. They have full control over these lands. They have allegiance to no faction or team. The goal of those who work there is to make money by doing their job well. They always work very hard no matter if they are working for CI or somebody else.

In the heart of the building, there's a place called the “Shrine of A” crafted from ancient metal that has moss and vines all over it. Unique ancient symbols are all over the statue with writing that could mean all sorts of things. The ancient writing says stuff all about the history of the company. The writing also supposedly states the location of a relic a part of the legendary 56. 56 relics are so powerful that they were scattered across lands decades ago. It is said that wielding one of these relics may have the power of multiple normal relics.

This place is a very significant place, but the owner remains unknown till this day. This building is known to be very strong with many ways to attack invaders and is suspected to have inventions that only they possess. The owner of this company supposedly also owns the “Lime Tower”, however, there is no proof of this or confirmation from anyone.
