## Aethelstone (sunstone)

`ðŸ“œ Item`

_Aethelstone_ is a previously unknown earth mineral discovered within the [Aethelstone Mining Cave](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aethelstone_mining_cave.html>) in [Xyrclaox Watch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>). It is believed that the mineral's unique properties are a result of its interaction with the CR buildup beneath the ground that preceeded [eon 1131 CR outburst](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1131>).

In its raw form, _Aethelstone_ is dark charcoal in color with a rough, matte texture that appears dusty, yet feels surprisingly smooth to the touch. Despite not radiating noticeable heat in darkness, direct contact with unprotected skin causes a long-lasting, sunburn-like irritation, earning it the common nickname "Sunstone." Interestingly, individuals working in proximity to _Aethelstone_ often develop a tan similar to that caused by sunlight despite feeling no heat from it.

The large chunks of _Aethelstone_ slowly heat up when exposed to the sunlight or candlelight, steadily getting hotter and eventually splitting into smaller parts. These smaller chunks hear up even faster, with the smallest of particles of _Aethelstone_ decaying almost explosively.

The primary use of _Aethelstone_ is in specialized power generation facilities. Within these complex stations, the mineral is carefully burned in a controlled process using intricate light systems to release its energy. Due to the complexity of these power generation stations, raw _Aethelstone_ requires careful and secure transportation to other regions outside _Xyrclaox Watch_.

Due to its highly reactive nature to light, especially in powdered form, _Aethelstone_ must be kept in complete darkness. Specialized, sturdy containers are used for its storage and transport to prevent accidental ignition. Even trace amounts of _Aethelstone_ dust are extremely reactive and can cause intense burns when exposed to light. As a result, miners working in the _Aethelstone_ caves undergo a strict cleaning procedure before exiting into daylight to ensure no particles are carried out.

_Aethelstone_ is a relatively recent discovery in the Zeithalt world and remains the subject of intense study by the MindTech Institute and other researchers. Its full potential and any other unique properties beyond power generation are still being investigated.
