## Alpickle Goats

`ðŸ“ƒ Term`

_Alpickle Goats_ are a type of mountain goats that are endemic to the region of [Mt. Pickles](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mt_pickles.html>) as they only live in the harsh mountains located there, mainly in the east side of _Mt. Pickles_ due to the geography of it.

To live comfortably in these mountains, they have evolved to have thicker fur than most goats, which helps when people harvest their furs to make thick winter clothing. They also have sizably longer horns than average goats, which truly starts to differentiate them from other goats.

They use these horns in a bit of a unique way, every 2 to 3 months these goats would wait for a thundersnow (a thunderstorm but snow falls instead of rain). When they find such weather, they climb the highest mountain they can find, hold their horns high above which are also very electrically conductive and wait for a lightning to fall on them. Their horns then absorb said lightning, and they direct some energy the strike to make their furs "poof" while the rest gets stored on their body near their horns. It is also stated that their milk would occasionally zap people a bit when they undergo this process.

They then use this stored electricity as a defence mechanism as when they want to ram something or somebody, they can also shock their opponent like a tazer on top of the usual ramming.
