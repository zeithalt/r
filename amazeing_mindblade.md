## 🗡️ A-maze-ing Mindblade

`📜 Item`

Hidden in the deepest point of the [maze](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/maze.html>), it was ready to share its power to anyone brave and mindful enough to go there across all the mysterious walls and traps surrounding it. 

Its power was first unleashed by former [MindTech](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) Headmaster [Dino Saurex](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/curious_dino.html>) on eon 1293, and it is now property of the _MindTech Institute_, to be wielded by its Headmaster.
