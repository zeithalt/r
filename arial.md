## üíâ Antibody Research Institute and Library

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark` in [Cerene Vale](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cerene_vale>)

Built on eon 1168 by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva>)

_ARIaL_ in short, this complex of a scientific, medical and, less public, military purpose.

Its purpose is research, discovery and storage of new and known antibodies targeting a wide range of toxins and pathogens. 

The motivation for those activities is in production of antisera granting immunity to various diseases, as well as to possible biological weapons.

While _Antibody Research Institute_ handles research, _Antibody Library_ is responsible for storage of biological samples - antibodies (phage display libraries) and cDNA libraries with genes encoding the former (genetically modified bacteria cultures).

One of the most significant projects of the _ARI_, realized in cooperation with [Modern CR Research Facility](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/modern_cr_research_facility.html>) is researching the possibility of creating antibodies targeting [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>), thus allowing for production of antisera used to speed up recovery from the Corruption Sickness.
