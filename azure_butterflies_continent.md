_Azure Butterflies Continent_ (also known as ABC Resort or simply ABC) is a seaside resort located on a small plateau among the peaks of _Indigo Shores_. It's open to the beautiful view of the ocean from one side while also shielded from the coastal winds from the other.

The resort offers its visitors comfortable hotel rooms, an open-air restaurant near the shore, a spacious gymnasium with a variety of equipment, as well as a spa and a small shopping district. The main attraction, however, is its garden that doubles as a sanctuary for several species of butterflies with blue-colored wings, born this way thanks to the mysterious phenomenon behind the blue waters of the region. Rumor goes that such a butterfly touching you can bring good fortune or clarity of mind, however, the staff advises against attempting to catch one, as the insects are rare and fragile creatures.

Local souvenir shops sell various merchandise that incorporates the butterflies in its design: hairpins, bracelets, necklaces and shirts, among other items. One can also purchase postcards with depictions of the butterfly garden and shoreline landscapes there.

The resort's slogan is "Your azure-colored paradise", a simple yet memorable sentence that is rarely left out of the conversation, be the name _"Azure Butterflies Continent"_ mentioned. Its options remain affordable, while making even the shortest visit worth the spent money, living up to the proclaimed title of a paradise in the hearts of most visitors.
