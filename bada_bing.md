## ðŸ’ƒ The Bada Bing!

`ðŸª§ Place` in [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>)

Built on eon 962 by the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>)

The Bada Bing! was originally the Mafia's main headquarters in [Meadowridge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/meadowridge.html>). However, when [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) attacked and captured _Brickland Fortress_, the criminal group was driven out. When _Brickland Fortress_ was handed back to [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>), the place was repurposed into a combination of museum and dance studio.

The Museum houses exhibits about the history and cultures of Zeithalt Island, with explanations available in both [Common](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/common_language.html>) and [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltan_language.html>) languages.

The dance studio provides plenty of space for physical activity and allows people to practice and showcase their culture through dance. Rumor has it that it was a strip club, but the mafia wiped out all evidence confirming or denying the rumor.

A small bar was found in the area as well, but it remained unoccupied. Rumor has it that a Juice Bar might open there, but no confirmation has been made.
