`ðŸª§ Place` in [Cybertron Jungle](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybertron_jungle.html>)

Build on eon 494 by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)

A huge bamboo grove, which includes about 140 species of this interesting plant. It is actively used by local residents as a building material due to its availability, high growth rate, and ease of processing.

The bamboo grove is also home to rare species of various animal families, such as bears, hares, canines, birds, snakes, ungulates, and others that live only in this type of woodland.

The bamboo grove is an excellent supplier of rare meats for [Brother's Meat Market](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brothers_meat_market.html>). Hunters from all over Zeithalt flock here to get another rare trophy and surprise the market's management and their customers with another curiosity.

Environmentalists and animal rights activists are concerned about such a large influx of poachers, so the authorities are taking the toughest methods to combat illegal hunting.
