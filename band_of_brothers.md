## Band of Brothers

`ðŸªª Faction`

Founded on [eon 959](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0959>), the Band of Brothers is comprised primary from people of Deltan heritage and occupies several formerly Deltan lands in the west part of the Island.

Synopsis:
> _We are NOT affiliated with the criminal part of life on Zeithalt. If someone did something illegal somewhere, it does NOT mean that Band of Brothers is involved._

The Band of Brothers initially was a group of former Deltans who seized control of the [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>) region - then occupied by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) - and declared independence there.

However, in the [Battle of Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0962>), the _Brothers_ were driven out of the region when [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) recaptured the region.

The faction then reached a deal with [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>), which effectively separated the Deltan faction into two parts, with _Band of Brothers_ taking under control the western regions of [Indigo Shore](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/indigo_shore.html>), [Dev Null Marsh](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh.html>) and [Imperial Swamp](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/imperial_swamp.html>). The latter subsequently became the new faction's capital.
