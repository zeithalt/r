## 🙏 Beacon of Hope

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Illusion Cliffs](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/illusion_cliffs>)

Built on eon 1296 by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute>)

Constructed during a time of great turmoil after the [loss of Paradox Pass](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1286>), the _Beacon of Hope_ stands on the shores of the _Illusion Cliffs_. It serves as a defiant symbol of the _MindTech Institute's_ enduring spirit.

While more modest than other grand [MT Beacons](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/beacon_of_reason.html>), this structure is built from precious marble mined from the local cliffs. At its top sits a device crafted from the crystals of the [Cave of Mirrors](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cave_of_mirrors.html>), which reflect and refract light. This apparatus gathers ambient light, casting a single, unwavering beam westwards towards the occupied territory.

Visible from [Paradox Pass](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/paradox_pass.html>) on a clear day during the sunrise, the beacon's light is a silent message to the citizens there, a promise that they are not forgotten.

A poem is inscribed at the beacon's base, as a testament to the faction's resilience:

> *When despair reigns,  
> And darkness comes,   
> Walls may be gone,  
> Stones turn to dust,  
> While thought remains,  
> Hope shines the light,  
> The minds will stand,  
> And end the night.*
