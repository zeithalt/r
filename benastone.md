## üè† Benastone

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark` in [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>)

Built on eon 998 by [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) 

Benastone (Formerly [Bumpstown](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/bumps.html>)) is a heavily defended border town in the Southeastern Sector of the [Timeless Desert](timeless_desert.html), with a population of 14,000 to 16,000 inhabitants, known as _Benastarians_. The city was originally established on eon 312 by inhabitants of [MindTech](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) origin. Due to the desert's time dilation, the city remained shrouded and hidden from public view, even considered an urban legend by those who attempted to venture into the timeless sands.

Benastone was officially oriented to Zeithaltian Time on eon 998, thanks to the scientific efforts of the Humble [Abode](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/humble_abode.html>) ChronoLogic (HACL) team. 

The name change from _Bumpstown_ occurred after the declaration of independence on eon 915 was peacefully resolved with the new name originating from the town's production of _Benas‚Ñ¢Ô∏è_, a modified bean product initially developed with the assistance of Cloudy Company, which continues to play a central role in the town's economy today.

The town contains its own districts, jurisdiction, and government, acting as one of the many autonomous entities in the _Timeless Desert_. However, it remains under the protection of the [Corporatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>), maintaining occasional relations through the delivery of gold, credits, and resources as tributes or contributions to the desert's scientific endeavors.
