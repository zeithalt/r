Built on eon 1222 by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute>)

Big Mean Machine (colloquially referred to as "bee-em-em") is an automated military training facility located in the less mountainous area of _Xyrclaox Watch_, near the [Synaxos](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) and [Paradox Pass](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/paradox_pass.html>) tri-border. It was established after the severance of diplomatic relations by [Cybernetics Inc.](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) to prepare _MindTech_ soldiers for potential conflict.

The facility features a dynamic, open-air training arena with self-configurable walls and obstacles, simulating various combat scenarios. It also houses a sophisticated underground network of machinery that operates the facility. Theory rooms and auditoriums are also provided when scholars training on _Cybernetics Inc_.'s tactics and technology, and learn to see past _Cybers_ diplomatic strategies.

The _BMM_ offers highly realistic training experiences, utilizing mechanized opponents to simulate diverse combat scenarios. It is continuously updated with new scenarios designed by the _MindTech_ military branch, ensuring a constant stream of challenges for the trainees.

The _BMM_ is a crucial part of _MindTech_'s defensive efforts to prepare for any potential conflicts with _Cybernetics Inc._, providing essential training and experience to its soldiers in the face of an increasingly unpredictable and hostile neighbor.
