`ðŸª§ Place` in [Cybertron Jungle](../public_lore/atlas/cybertron_jungle.html)

Built on eon 1012 by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

A sanctuary where the most endangered species of the Cybertron Jungles are *protected* and *studied*. The sanctuary utilizes biomechanical enhancements to aid in the healing and adaptation of wildlife, merging organic life with cybernetic implants to ensure their survival in the evolving environment.

The reserve includes observation domes, research centers, and habitat simulations that blend seamlessly into the jungle environment, allowing scientists to monitor and interact with both natural and cyber-enhanced species.

The *Purpose* of this Sanctuary is to Conserves endangered species and explores the ethical implications of bio-cybernetic integration.
