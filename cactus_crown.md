## ðŸ‘‘ Cactus Crown

`ðŸ“œ Item`

_The Cactus Crown_ is skillfully forged from an ancient alloy, the recipe for which has long been lost. It is decorated with many sharp spikes, precious stones, and magical crystals.

The spikes protrude not only outward, threatening anyone who dares to approach, but also inward, as if to pierce the wearer's very essence. However, the spikes cause no inconvenience to their rightful owner.

The true owner of this crown is [T](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/t.html>), but how or under what circumstances he acquired it remains unknown.

This crown is a symbol of the power of the _Cactus Tsar_, and it chooses its bearer. Anyone unworthy who tries to don it will be unable to bear its powerâ€”their mind will be shattered, their body will buckle under its weight, and the inner spikes will mercilessly pierce their flesh.

The crown is a powerful ancient artifact and a vast source of magical power. Its full properties are known only to its owner, who closely guards its secrets.
