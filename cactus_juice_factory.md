## 🌵 Cactus Juice Factory

`🖼️ Landmark`

Started production on eon 761.

It is a life-long project and the place of eventual retirement of  _MCCACTUSSON_ esteemed member of the [Council of Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/council_of_minds.html>).

Despite the climate of Synaxos Fields not being well-fitted to the flora imported from the [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>), the ingenius climate-altering contraptions designed and built by _MCCACTUSSON_ allowed for a striving business.

The factory provides a steady supply of cactus-related produce to the [Neuropolis](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/neuropolis.html>) and nearby lands, eliminating the dangers and uncertainty that arise when such products are delivered from the Desert itself.
