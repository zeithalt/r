## ðŸ§¥ Cactus Mantle

`ðŸ“œ Item`

This artifact grants its owner excellent protection from both physical and magical attacks by bonding to their soul. Ownership cannot be taken by force; any would-be usurper will be eliminated by the mantle's own power.

It is made from an unusual fabric of unknown origin. From a distance, it appears to be ordinary cloth, but up close, one can see rows of sharp, strong spikes that are constantly in motion, like the legs of a spider.

These small, powerful spikes are its main defense, creating an invisible shield around the wearer that no ordinary weapon can penetrate.

It's believed that only representatives of the _Cactus Race_ can wear this artifact.

Two such mantles are known to exist in Zeithalt. The first belongs to [T](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/t.html>); it is now stained red with the blood of his enemiesâ€”a stain that, to his great regret, will not wash out. He is driven into a rage whenever reminded of this fact. The second mantle, _T_ gifted to an individual named _Picky_. This one retains its original, noble emerald color.
