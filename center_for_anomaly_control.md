## 🏢 Center for Anomaly Control

`🪧 Place` in [Neuropolis](/neuropolis.md)

Center for Anomaly Control (CAC) was built on eon 511 by [MindTech Institute](/mindtech_institute.md) under supervision of [Xiavente](/xiavente.md), shortly after the [Disaster of Synaxos Fields](t/eon0508.md).

With the access to the lands of [Synaxos](/synaxos_fields.md) being extremely dangerous, the Center had to be constructed as close to it as possible, while maintaining the direct connection to [Neuropolis](/neuropolis.md) for better supply lines in the emergency situation.

The Center for Anomaly Control served as a hub of operations during the [CR Restoration Research](/cr_restoration_project.md) and the _Synaxos Restoration Project_ soon after.

However, CAC did not escape its fair share of controversy, as the first weapon-grade [CR Artifacts](/cr_artefacts.md) are believed to have been developed and tested on its grounds.

Later, the resources of the Center were used in Restoration Projects in other lands, including the ones held by other factions and to this day the CAC remains a crucial point of CR Research.
