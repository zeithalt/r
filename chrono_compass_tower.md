## üß≠ Chrono-Compass Tower

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark` in [Paradox Pass](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/paradox_pass.html>)

Built on eon 1208 by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

The Chrono-Compass Tower is a monumental structure made of intricately layered stonework. It serves as a hub for navigation and trade within Paradox Pass and the surrounding regions.

It houses a sophisticated device that uses a vast archive of chronoglass tablets for orientation and route planning. By analyzing these tablets, navigators can chart the most efficient paths for travelers and traders across _MindTech Institute_ lands, ensuring the swiftest possible journeys.

Several big ornate dials are set into the _Tower_'s facade on each of the sides, their surfaces etched with complex symbols and moving components.

One dial on each side is used to keep track of time, while the others feature unfamiliar arrangements of gears, lenses, and calibrated rings with each side of the tower serving its own purpose. The true function of these elaborate mechanisms is understood only by the skilled navigators who operate within.

The presence of the _Chrono-Compass Tower_ significantly enhances trade and travel not only within _Paradox Pass_ but throughout the neighboring regions, making it a crucial nexus for commerce and passage.
