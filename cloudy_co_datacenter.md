`ü™ß Place` in [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>)

Built on eon 507 by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

An maze-like floor of the [Humble Abode](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/humble_abode.html>) for storing unnumerable memory banks, originally built by MindTech Institute in the Timeless Desert in 507E, Its original purpose was the store outsider and foreign information into memory banks connected to Minds for the purpose of espionage ranging from the smallest of secrets and scariest of scoops, managed by the now disbanded and former members of Bureau of Agent and Postal Service as the Blucore Administrative Processor System, a PIPS (Processed Information Per Second) management department belonging to BluCore Networking.

Ever since the formal deployment and deployment of the Cloudy Operatives in the desert and a recent time anomaly occurring between the period 700-800E, the CDC is now used in the transfer and collection of PIPS, PIPS are units of mental energy collected by various beings of the Timeless Desert, due to the recent time anomaly dubbed "Memory Reprocession", any beings capable of thought inside the Timeless Desert occasionally experience distracting memories or slowed down mental processing, this has heavily affected work efficiency and increase accidental casualties as this anomaly can cause one to experience temporary cognitive impairment, the CDC and its various surface tower's function is to majorly reduce those effects and collect Reprocessions as PIPS to be used in a more helpful manner.

PIPS have a variety of uses, it can be "spent" to activate and recall skills or talents that you or your prerequisites have honed efficiently, such cases where PIPS were recorded to be used are; A CI Roboticist "spent" PIPS to temporarily boost the efficiency and repair a broken fabricator, a scholar from MT was able to recall and single-handedly perfectly mix a solution with accurate precision, a team of Silvan botanists were able to grow a batch of cabbage with 43% better harvest yield without the use of any enhancer, an untrained civilian normally are capable on possessing a maximum of 10 PIPS at a time.
