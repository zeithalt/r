## Council of Minds

`ðŸ“‘ Term`

A governing body of [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) that resides in [Cortexian Hall](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cortexian_hall.html>), consisting of recognized citizens, skilled warriors and prominent scholars of the faction.

The members of the Council are called _Masters_ and serve for life, or until they resign or are removed from the Council by the other members.

The leader of the Council is called the _Headmaster_, who also acts as a Headmaster of the Institute. Headmaster is elected among the Masters of the Council by the MindTech Institute followers (not limited to Masters).

The Council is as old as the faction itself, and its history ranges from the ultimate power on the island during the times it was led by [hexAgon](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/hexagon.html>) to the complete dissolution during the times of [Loki](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/loki.html>)'s dictatorship.

The Council was restored on [Eon 755](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0755>) following the fall of the ruthless dictator.
