## Corruption Restoration Project

`ðŸ“‘ Term`

A project initially developed to recover [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) from [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) surge that happened in [Eon 508](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0508>).

Since then, it has been reviewed and adapted to be used in other areas of the Island affected by _Corruption_.
