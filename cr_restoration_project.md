## Corruption Restoration Project

`📑 Term`

A project initially developed to recover [Synaxos Fields](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html) from [Corruption](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html) surge that happened in [Eon 508](https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0508).

Since then, it has been reviewed and adapted to be used in other areas of the Island affected by _Corruption_.
