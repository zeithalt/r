Located on the coast in Imperial Swamp, the school offers state-of-the-art courses for beginners and experienced divers. Different approaches to training, group lessons or individual ones.

The students of the school not only learn to scuba dive, but also participate in the search for ancient artifacts and treasures, exploring reefs, underwater grottoes and wrecks of sunken ships.

There are rumors that organized crime has got its hands on this place, but few people are interested in this, so no one has even tried to find out anything.
