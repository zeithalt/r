A duck farm is a place where cute ducks are bred. Right? Well, of course, that was the plan from the start!

However, over time and under the influence of the chaotic forces, the ducks began to mutate, sometimes turning into terrible monsters. Mutations were superimposed on mutations, and the farm administration, together with the veterinarians, only threw up their hands and said that this place was bad, and they could not do anything about it.

It got to the point that the ducks began to evolve and seized power on the farm. Under the leadership of their leader Holy Quack, they rebelled, declared this place the Autonomous Republic of Ducks and expelled all the farm workers from "their" territory.

What is currently happening behind the fence is not known for certain, but local residents and the former administration of the farm are very concerned, because sometimes the sounds of forging metal can be heard from behind the fence, as well as slogans like: "Death to the oppressors!", "In the name of our Great Leader Holy Quack!"
