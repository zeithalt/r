## 🌀 Entropy Harmonizer

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Purple Deeps](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/purple_deeps.html>)

Built on eon 1145 by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>).

A powerful device installed in the underground tunnels of Purple Deeps to control the city's entropy and chaos levels for defensive purposes.

It's been rumored to exist ever since the [first siege of the Deltan capital](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0611>) where it supposedly caused interruptions in battles, but was largely considered a city myth or part of a disinformation campaign.

Its existence was finally confirmed during the [4th Siege of Purple Deeps](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1139>), where it was used openly and extensively to protect the inner city.
