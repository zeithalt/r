## Fighters Guild

**ðŸªª Group**

A self-organised military group founded by 4 prominent sellswords: AlexxDev, Eldar, Revalx and Dino on Eon 690.

Fighters Guild sees its goal in allowing sellswords of all kinds get support both in and outside of the battlefield, while at the same time maximising profits for the Guild members by selling their services to warring factions.
