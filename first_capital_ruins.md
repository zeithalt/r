## First Capital Ruins

`🖼️ Landmark`

Reopened on Eon 829, shortly after the [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) retook the [A'as Forest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest.html>) back [under control](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0825>).

This place is the biggest archaeological site in MindTech lands, and it's a popular destination for tourists and researchers alike.

Although the ruins are mostly destroyed or lay buried under the forest, part of the excavation site is open to the public. It contains a museum and a working ancient auditorium that hosts open lectures on the life and legacy of [King A'as](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/king_aas.html>), the [First Capital](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/first_capital.html>) and the science of archaeology in general.

Beneath the open part of the ruins are catacombs, which are still being excavated. The catacombs are believed to contain the remains of the ancient city's inhabitants, as well as the King A'as burial chambers. The latter, however, is yet to be found.
