## 🌀 Fractal Fields

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields>)

Built on eon 1199 by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute>)

The _Fractal Fields_ are one of the features that gave the _Synaxos Fields_ region its name. 

These fields grow in an intricate, self-repeating pattern that depends on how the rainfall affects the underlying aquifer each year. One can easily get lost in this complex maze of unusually large wheat and corn crops, which are known for their size and yield.

Ever since the [first battle of Synaxos Fields on eon 298](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0298>), the _MindTech Institute_ has been training their scholars to study the fields and orient themselves within them as a means to guerilla warfare in the region. Scholars use their math skills, statistical data, and practical probes from the ground to determine and calculate patterns in their location.

Interestingly, these plans were never put to use, as the region has only seen [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) outbreaks and the subsequent [Corruption Restoration](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_restoration_project.html>) efforts ever since the [Disaster of Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0508>).
