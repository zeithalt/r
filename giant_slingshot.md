## üèπ Giant Slingshot

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark` in [Indigo Shore](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/indigo_shore.html>)

Built on eon 587 by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

A giant slingshot with an automatic loading mechanism. Used by [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) to throw bombs on the battlefield.

It has an automatic guidance system that uses magical energy, choosing a target for the shelling in accordance with the flows of chaotic energy during Deltan combat operations.

The firing range depends on the size of the slingshot, which changes up or down under the influence of magical forces, which allows you to shell any land where the Deltans are currently fighting. 

The speed of the projectile's flight exceeds any laws of physics, and the bombs fly to their destination almost instantly. Reloading under intense shelling usually takes about 10 seconds. It Does not require repair or maintenance.

Many of the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>), as former members of the Delta Collective, also have access to the controls and all the functions of the slingshot, which allows both factions to effectively use this weapon at the same time.
