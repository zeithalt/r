## 🔦 Guidelight System

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Oblivion Mire](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html>)

Completed on eon 805 by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>), this system provides guidance to travelers through the treacherous swamps of _Oblivion Mire_.

The system consists of lights set up in such a way that a traveler only ever sees the next guiding light on their path, and walking directly towards it allows for a safe passage.

The Guidelight System consists of two main routes:
- The Primary Path goes from west to east, connecting [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>) to [A'as Forest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest.html>), with a separate branch going towards Paradox Pass, connecting directly to [Axonite Road](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/axonite_road.html>).
- The Secondary Path going from north to south, connecting [Blue Screen Lagoon](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/blue_screen_lagoon.html>) to [Cerene Vale](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cerene_vale.html>).

These paths mostly go along the same routes Mire's inhabitants use for ceonturies. However, the Guidelight System provides a reliable and relatively safe way to navigate these routes much quicker and without the need to employ local villagers as guides.
