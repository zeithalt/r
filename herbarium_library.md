## ðŸ“— Herbarium Library

`ðŸª§ Place` in [Cerene Vale](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cerene_vale.html>)

Built on eon 1000 by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)

Herbarium Library is a giant library created to gather all the information [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) has gathered and keeps gathering about various plant species all across Zeithalt in a single, organized place.

The ground floor, 1st floor and 2nd floor of it simply act as a giant library that allows scholars, students or just people who are simply curious to easily access information about various plant species while its basement floor is restricted to only certain individuals where backup documents are kept, so the information is not lost in such cases where every information gathered about a species disappears.
