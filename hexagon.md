## hexAgon

`üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Character`

He is a member of the Council of Minds, founder of the *Interfactional Poetry Contest* as well as one of the top fighters under the orange flag but not much is known about him.


His date and place of birth are unknown and very little is known about his actual residence: it is rumored that he lives in an invisible tower in the Institute's Fortress in Neuropolis and that he has a non-human creature as a servant and confidant.

Opinions about him are conflicting: for some he is the spiritual guide of the Institute, for others he is just a troublemaker.

Those who studied in the Fortress describe him as the headmaster of the Institute as well as a teacher of Ancient Runes. His lessons are judged by everyone to be "*extremely boring*".

It seems that he is in possession of [a rare artifact](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_gemstone.html>) found in the dunes of the [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>) after the first battle against Corruption (eon 272): there is not much information about it.

They say he has a weakness for chocolate cookies.

At some point [Double-Z](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/zeithalt_zeitgeist.html>) was hyping rumours that hexAgon might be addicted to drinking baby unicorn blood, however that story remains unconfirmed and is believed to be a newspaper hoax
