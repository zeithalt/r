## ðŸ”« Hooly Gun of the INKuisition

`ðŸ“œ Item`

A modified version of the classic semi-automatic [Mafia](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/capos_of_mafia.html>) weapon.

Its appearance is mesmerizing: The body is forged from a solid silver alloy containing consecrated metal, with every inch covered in ancient runes. The handle is made of dark wood, inlaid with the bones of sinners. The barrel is slightly elongated, featuring an engraved cross and skull at the muzzle, while the trigger is adorned with a tiny figure of a fallen angel.

When the weapon is pointed at a sinner, the runes glow crimson and a whisper sounds in the owner's ear: "Bring justice." After the shot, white smoke with the scent of incense emanates from the barrel. Its silver bullets pass through flesh, leaving wounds that will not heal, and the victim's soul will find no peace until the weapon is used to kill someone it deems "worse."

If an innocent person is killed by the weapon, the runes go dark, and the owner hears a distorted, long-suffering whisper: "*Holy... what have you done?*" And, considering a [Capo of the Mafia](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/statue_of_ink.html>) owns this weapon, he hears this quite often.
