## ‚òØ Isle Of Solitude

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark` in [Illusion Cliffs](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/illusion_cliffs>)

Built on eon 1298 by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute>)

In a peaceful, secluded bay within the _Illusion Cliffs_ lies a small, wooded island known to local fishers as the _Isle of Solitude_.

Though an island can be accessed by a wooden bridge, a visitor is greeted by a simple, hand-drawn wooden sign that reads: "Visitors are loved and respected, but not really welcome."  This gentle request for privacy is honored by the few locals who know of the place.

The inhabitant is the former Headmaster of the _MindTech Institute_, [Dino Saurex](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/curious_dino.html>).  Weary from the betrayals, heartbroken after the _MindTech_ _Era of Peace_ was brutally ended and disheartened by the decline of the _Institute_ over the last hundred eons, _Dino_ retreated to this island, taking a vow of silence.

From the shore, one can see a tidy path leading into the trees and glimpses of well-tended fruit trees, but the old Master's dwelling and private garden are deliberately hidden from view. His days are spent in quiet reflection and grounding, mundane tasks. He tends his garden, carves intricate figures from driftwood, and spends long hours watching the unique, colorful tides of the _Cliffs_.

Though he is isolated, he is not entirely cut off. Official _MindTech_ couriers are sometimes spotted traveling in the bay, reportedly carrying supplies and correspondence to and from the secluded island.
