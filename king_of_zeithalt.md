## ðŸ‘‘ King of Zeithalt

`ðŸ“‘ Term`

A new King of Zeirhalt is chosen every once in a while by a process known as _The King's Challenge_. 

The Challenge is a series of tests and trials that the candidates must pass to prove their worthiness to rule. 

However, some speculate that in the end, the winner is chosen randomly.

The King of Zeithalt has been a mostly ceremonial figure for the past few ceonturies, but [the recent events](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1015>) have shown that the King might also yield significant power in battles.
