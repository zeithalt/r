## 🧼 Laundry N°131691

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Indigo Shore](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/indigo_shore.html>)

Built on eon 1027 by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>).

The best laundry on Zeithalt Island according to unbiased reviews of willing and unwilling customers. 

The Laundry boasts to use the best technology and materials for cleaning with the quality guarantee. 100% cleaning of any stains, except magical blood (this cannot be washed out).

[T](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/t.html>) called it "The most useless investment of money", before that he ~~killed~~ fired several employees because they could not wash his Noble Emerald Cactus Mantle from the blood of his enemies.

Rumor has it that the laundry room number means something, but no one knows for sure.

Other rumors are that this building is one of the many mafia headquarters, but there is no exact confirmation of this, any attempts to find out have probably ended with the investigators disappearing without a trace.
