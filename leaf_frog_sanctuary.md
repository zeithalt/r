## 🐸 Leaf Frog Sanctuary

`🪧 Place` in [Oblivion Mire](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html>)

Built on eon 837 by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

This is a place for study and preservation of the Mire's unique *Leaf Frogs*. 

This species got its name due to their color and shape being similar to the small young leaves. These frogs are found almost exclusively in the [Lower Mire](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/lower_mire_area.html>) - the deepest and most dangerous part of the Oblivion Mire.

Despite their benign appearance, the *Leaf Frogs* are venomous and can be lethal to humans. The diluted *Leaf Frog Venom* has been used by the mirefolk for ceonturies as an antiseptic to prevent infections and stop wounds from festering.

Being the most remote and hard to reach area, the *Lower Mire* suffered the most during the [Corruption outburst on eon 536](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0536>). This led to the excessive growth of the bloodvines in the area and subsequent reduction of the lands suitable for Leaf Frog habitat.

Answering the requests of locals, MindTech Institute funded the creation and maintenance of the Leaf Frog Sanctuary on the outskirts of the Lower Mire. The Sanctuary provides the perfect conditions for the Leaf Frogs, while also serving as a source of disinfectants, antiseptic solutions and other products based on *Leaf Frog Venom*.
