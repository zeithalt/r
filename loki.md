## Loki

`üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Character`

Loki is a famous (or some may say infamous) MT member that quickly rose through the ranks to the position of Defense Minister and eventually became a [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) dictator.

His story includes a range of diverse moments: from being a humble owner of the [Valhalla Bar](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/valhalla_bar.html>) to dark allegations of killing the preceding Defense Minister of MindTech.

But it's the [Burning of Cerene Vale](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0749>) that will forever be associated with his name, as a brutal outburst of unnecessary violence, event for which the full responsibility was taken by Loki himself.

This very same event is quoted to be the sole reason for his downfall and the [restoration of the Council of Minds in MT on eon 755](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0755>).
