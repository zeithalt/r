## Lower Mire (area)

`ðŸª§ Place`

The deepest and the most dangerous part of the [Oblivion Mire](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html>).

Being the most remote and hard to reach area, the *Lower Mire* suffered the most during the [Corruption outburst on eon 536](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0536>). This led to the excessive growth of the bloodvines in the area, making the area even worse than it was.
