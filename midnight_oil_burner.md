## 🔥 Midnight Oil Burner

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Illusion Cliffs](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/illusion_cliffs.html>)

Built on eon 1192 by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>).

A study center for late-night deep concentration and a peaceful get-away location in the picturesque stone crater near the East shore of Illusion Cliffs.

Before being turned into an official center, this place was long known among the locals as "Midnight Burner". Named so for its mysterious flames raising up from the walls of the crater, starting near midnight and going out by sunrise.

Early MindTech scholars got into the habit of pulling all-nighters here for their studies, altering the name to *Midnight Oil Burner* despite the place being a natural gas pit, and having no oil in it.
