Build on Eon 471 by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>), the complex known under the full name **Academy of Military Tactics and Defense Intelligence**.

It was founded to train tough and brave warriors for battle as well as develop intelligent informants, clever strategists and tacticians. The complex also serves as a central war room and military headquarters. The academy trains soldiers to defend their lands and fight for MT's righteous values.

At the center of the academy is the _[Revalx](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/revalx.html>) Memorial Park_, named after the former Ministry of Defense who founded the place. He is considered one of the outstanding leaders of his time. The infrastructure of the academy is further enhanced with the technology provided by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>).
