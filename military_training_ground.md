## 💥 Military Training Ground

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Cybertron Jungle](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybertron_jungle>)

Built on eon 1195 by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers>)

The military training ground is used to train new recruits for the shadow army of Band of Brothers. Its remote location in the dense, impenetrable jungle also makes it ideal for large-scale inter-faction exercises.

The training ground features an urban combat zone with mock-ups of buildings and streets, rugged terrain and forested areas for practicing combat tactics, and an underground complex for training in low visibility and tight spaces.

The training ground's instructors are veterans with extensive combat experience, many of whom have participated in ~~showdowns with competitors~~ operations throughout Zeithalt. They are known for their toughness, exactness, and deep understanding of tactics and strategy.

Each training session is as close to real combat conditions as possible, because after completing the training, elite fighters are distributed throughout Zeithalt to maintain the strength and influence of the ~~Mafia~~ Honest and Decent Citizens.
