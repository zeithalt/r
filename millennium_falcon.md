## `🦅` Millennium Falcon

`🧙‍♂️ Character`

Millennium Falcon is a legendary bird that is believed to be the only creature of the Island unaffected either by time, nor the non-linear timeflow of the [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>).

It is said that the bird exists _outside of time_, however it apparently has some concept of time, since in myths and legends it appears on the Insland every 1000 eons.
