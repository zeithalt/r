## Mimps Virus

**📑 Term**

Mimps is an infectious virus that suddenly and randomly appeared on the Zeithalt Island and has been prominent in the island ever since.

It can spread rapidly through personal interactions and can be challenging to contain at times. While no vaccine is available, the virus can be effectively eliminated using the Yarrow Extract Solution (or YES for short).

The virus was named in honor of the first two researchers who studied it Mimb and Bumps.
