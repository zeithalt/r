## MindTech Institute

**ðŸªª Faction**

MindTech Institute (MT) - one of the three original factions, which can boast the deep lore, long history and a rich economy - all propped up be the ideals of knowledge and growth held by its scholars.

Occupies the eastern part of the Island, with the capital in [Neuropolis](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/neuropolis.html>).

Synopsis:
> *Mind is the greatest tool any human has. Our studies have shown that with proper training and the right practices this tool may become the most powerful weapon ever available to the human race.*

The Institute had its share of [downfalls](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0384>), horrendous [decisions](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0749>) and ruthless [dictators](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/loki.html>).

However, after the restoration of the [Council of Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/council_of_minds.html>) it aims to achieve a balanced and respected position it once had under the guidance of its [most famous ruler](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/hexagon.html>).

The landmarks of MindTech Institute feature everything from [MT's famous towers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/institute_fortress_inner.html>) and impregnable [prison-fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/prefrenial_prefect.html>), to recreational [Cannabliss Camp](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cannabliss_camp.html>) and natural wonders such as the [Cave of Mirrors](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cave_of_mirrors.html>).

But above them all stands the [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>) - a sacred land, governed, studied and defended by MindTech Institute for more than 900 eons and eventually entrusted for protection to [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) after the times of [hardship](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/loki.html>),
