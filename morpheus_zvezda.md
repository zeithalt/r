## Morpheus Zvezda

`🧙‍♂️ Character`

Morpheus Zvezda (Звезда Морфея, _/Zvezd-ah Mor-fee-ya/_) is the identity that [Okeanida Zvezdnaya](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/okeanida.html>) assumes as a member of the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>). Usually, she wears a red poppy on her head as a symbol of her influence on dreams.

After discovering her ability to manipulate dreams, she fears that they may be used for malicious purposes, such as implanting perpetual fear or causing a loss of control in one's life. Thus, the journey begins to train herself to control her powers.

Rumour has it that she is among the many Oceanids (water nymphs) in the world and that her human form is just one of the many shapes she can shift into.
