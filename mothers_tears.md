In the western part of *A’as Forest* lies a group of small, clear and unusually bright-blue lakes known as *Mother’s Tears*. Their bright azure color comes from thick chalk and mineral deposits on the lakebeds, making the water look almost magical.

According to legend, these lakes appeared when *Queen Theciana* wept after learning about the death of her son *A’as*. Her deep love and sorrow turned into pure, clear water that still shines today.

To the *MindTech* people, the lakes stand for pure love and the bond between mother and child — a reminder of care that lasts beyond time.
