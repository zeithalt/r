## Mt. Pickles

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark`

The region of Mt. Pickles is a harsh, generally cold region located in the central-western part of the island. It is surrounded by different regions on all sides and thus, landlocked.

It features numerous mountains and hills throughout the region. Generally, the density and height of these mountains and hills increase as you approach the region's eastern border with [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>), which is divided by nearly untraversable mountain ranges.

These mountain ranges are accepted as the continuation of [Brickspire Mountains](brickspire_mountains.html). This mountain chain starts from the easternmost side of the region's narrow border with the region of [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>), then go all the way through Mt. Pickles's easternmost side and finally exit into its Northern neighbour, the region of [PEBKAC Peak](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/pebkac_peak.html>) in a shape that fully defines the region's border with [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>).

While there is no distinct border that divides the land into west and east sides, the differences in conditions of the region's west and east sides are pretty apparent. In the middle of the region is the single tallest mountain of both the entire region and much of the Zeithalt named also as Mt. Pickles, which gives the region its name. This enormous mountain serves as a landmark to determine the region's east and west by the locals.

East side of Mt. Pickles is cold, snowy and heavily mountainous, charactarized by rocky terrain and thus a generally harsh environment with barely any life in it. Besides some tiny, scattered villages located here, the majority of the life here consists of the region's endemic mountain goat population, the [Alpickle Goats](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/alpickle_goats.html>). These goats make up the majority of the East side's economy.

West side of Mt. Pickles is much more habitable compared to its eastern counterpart. It still has many mountains and has more greenery with its moderately sized pine forests both on and beneath some mountains here. It also has some rivers coming from said mountains which form small lakes all around the region. While the West side of Mt. Pickles is still cold and generally snowy, it's much more temperate and bearable compared to its East side.

There is much more life in the West side with many small villages all around the place. It also houses the region's capital and biggest town, which makes up both the majority of the region of Mt. Pickles's economy and its small population, the humble town of [Pineville](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/pineville.html>). Which is located near the border of [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>).
