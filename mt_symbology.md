## MindTech Symbology

`üìë Term`

Officially adopted on eon 768 by the [Council of Minds](/council_of_minds.md), these symbols are derived from the ancient [MindTech](/mindtech_institute.md) symbols used in the times of the [First Capital](/first_capital.md).

The following meanings are assigned to these symbols:

**The triquetra** the main symbol of the faction, symbolizes the tree [towers of MindTech Institute](/institute_fortress_inner.md).

**The surrounding circle** - for the control _MindTech_ has over the towers, and a reference to the mystic 4th tower.

**The triangle** further emphasises the unity of the towers, as well as the movement forward and forms the letter "M" with the white side-bands.

**The orange color** is the main color of the faction, derived from the **sands of the [Timeless Desert](/timeless_desert.md)** - sacred MT land.

**The black color** used exclusively on war flags and banners is the symbol of destruction and sacrifice the war brings, and a reference to [Corruption](/corruption.md) that arose from MT lands.
