## MindTech Symbology

`ðŸ“‘ Term`

Officially adopted on eon 768 by the [Council of Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/council_of_minds.html>), these symbols are derived from the ancient [MindTech](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) symbols used in the times of the [First Capital](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/first_capital.html>).

The following meanings are assigned to these symbols:

**The triquetra** the main symbol of the faction, symbolizes the tree [towers of MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/institute_fortress_inner.html>).

**The surrounding circle** - for the control _MindTech_ has over the towers, and a reference to the mystic 4th tower.

**The triangle** further emphasises the unity of the towers, as well as the movement forward and forms the letter "M" with the white side-bands.

**The orange color** is the main color of the faction, derived from the **sands of the [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>)** - sacred MT land.

**The black color** used exclusively on war flags and banners is the symbol of destruction and sacrifice the war brings, and a reference to [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) that arose from MT lands.

> **Official MT flag**  
> (main version, used for diplomatic and ceremonial purposes)
