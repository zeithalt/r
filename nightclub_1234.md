## ü™© Nightclub "1234"

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark` in [Dev Null Marsh](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh>)

Built on eon 1234 by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>).

Nightclub "1234" is a portal to an alternative reality, where the boundaries between worlds are erased. Behind the unremarkable facade of the building lies a space where chaos, rhythm, darkness ~~and mafia~~ rule.

On eon 1234, one [Great Master of Spatial Magic](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/t.html>) discovered that certain acoustic frequencies contain a code that can distort reality. He found an abandoned building where abnormal sound waves resonated and turned it into a hybrid of a club and an artifact. Since then, "1234" exists on the edge of worlds - partly in this world, partly in parallel worlds.

The first floor of the club is a dance floor with neon lasers piercing the smoke. The walls are covered with graffiti hiding the runes of a complex artifact. The second floor is divided into lounge zones, each of which is in a different reality. The third floor is a VIP zone, entry for ordinary visitors is prohibited. What exactly is going on there is not known for certain. However, there is a suspicion that under the cover of the VIP zone, there is another mafia headquarters.

The basement of the nightclub is closed with a door with a combination lock (1234). Not a very strong security system, but all the curious people who figured out how to open the door disappeared in this basement forever. If you look for the entrance to the basement on purpose, you will never find it. The basement itself will find you.

They say that the music never stops in the club. Because if the music is turned off, THEY will come from the basement. They will check everyone's documents and take all the dealers to the basement.

If the beat reaches 123.4 BPM, the space begins to "glitch" - people see shadows from other layers of reality, and the equipment comes to life on its own.

Every day at 12:34 a semi-transparent silhouette of a DJ appears at the DJ booth and turns on his unusual playlist. People who start dancing to this music disappear from view. This usually lasts for a few minutes, although sometimes it can last for several hours.

The reasons for some anomalies are unknown. _T_, the creator of the club-artifact, carefully records and studies these phenomena, using the club's guests as guinea pigs. "So what's the big deal? People are dancing, drinking, everyone's happy! And I'll just watch here for now. Oh, look: another fool has gone to the basement, hehe.."

Fun fact: the bar's menu includes a signature cocktail called "1234." When you order this cocktail, the bartender will pour you 1 shot of 123.4 ml. After you drink it, they'll pour you 2 more shots. Then 3, then 4 shots. After you drink the last shot, you'll hardly remember the rest of the evening.

During the construction of the Nightclub, an unpleasant incident occurred: At night, some old gray-haired geezer wandered onto the construction site and destroyed some walls of the building and parts of the scaffolding, mistaking it for a battlefield. In result, the building's commissioning date was postponed. For this, oldster was added to the blacklist for life under number 1 of the still unfinished establishment, and also in a huge quantity of other decent establishments of Zeithalt.
