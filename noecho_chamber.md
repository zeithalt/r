## 🔇 No-Echo Chamber

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Blue Screen Lagoon](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/blue_screen_lagoon.html>)

Built on eon 969 by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

So called No-Echo Chamber is a rock formation in one of the secluded [Blue Screen Lagoon's](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/blue_screen_lagoon.html>) bays.

Unique natural phenomena makes it so that any sound made inside the chamber is absorbed by the walls and never echoes back. This makes it a perfect place for meditation, reflection and private conversations.

As one of the Master of the Council once said: _"In the No-Echo Chamber, you can speak your mind without fear of being judged, for your words will never return to haunt you. Even your own thoughts have no echo here."_
