## Ogrodnik

`🧙‍♂️ Character`

A man of unknown origin, he appeared on the political scene of Zeithalt as an apprentice of [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) in Eon 260.

Quickly finding his way to the top during what some call Institute's Golden Age, he became a member of its Government. 

However, not a long time later, he resigned from that position and sparkled the creation of the 4th Faction, [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>).

Although an experienced warrior and active politician, in his personal life he is a calm and withdrawn person preferring [istant hideouts](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/botanical_garden.html>) over rowdy meeting rooms.
