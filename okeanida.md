## Okeanida Zvezdnaya

`üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Character`

_Okeanida Zvezdnaya_ (–û–∫–µ–∞–Ω–∏–¥–∞ –ó–≤–µ–∑–¥–Ω–∞—è, _/oh-kay-ah-NEE-dah zvezd-NAH-yah/_) is an amnesiac girl with a great fascination for the stars. The people know her as a kind, gentle, and helpful person. Her physical beauty and graceful movement are simply a cherry on top of her already excellent manners, making it her primary method of communication.

She suffers from a speech disorder, that prevents her from speaking. To compensate, she is proficient in other aspects of language, such as listening, writing, and reading. Thus, writing becomes her alternative method to deliver a message formally. She could "speak" to others _if_ specific conditions are met, but even then it is temporary.

Her past and origin are mostly unknown. Not even she can remember anything beyond the day she was saved by the locals in Indigo Shore. And to her, she is fine not knowing the past, because she is content with the present life she has now.
