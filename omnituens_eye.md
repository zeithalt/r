## 👁 Omnituens Eye 

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Webified Hills](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/webified_hills.html>)

Built on eon 1168 by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

After the [loss of Cybertron Jungle](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1158>) and its vital research facilities, _Cybernetics Inc_ resolved to construct a far more advanced observatory, drawing upon knowledge accumulated over a thousand eons. 

At its core lies the [Omnituens Lens](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/omnituens_lens.html>) — a powerful artifact forged from countless rare and invaluable resources. This lens serves as it's key, allowing one to peer into distant galaxies and even across the boundaries of different universes.

Due to the immense power it holds, the _Omnituens Lens_ remains in [NAIRO](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/nairo.html>)’s possession, while all records detailing its creation have been systematically erased—burned and deleted to ensure its secrets never fall into the wrong hands.
