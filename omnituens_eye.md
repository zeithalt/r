## 👁 Omnituens Eye 

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Webified Hills](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/webified_hills.html>)

Built on eon 1168 by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

An observatory built inside a hill in by [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) after they lost the [Photonic Observatory](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/photonic_observatory.html>) to the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>).

This building was created using the accumulated knowledge of over a thousand eons. 

The core item needed for its operation is [Omnituens Lens](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/omnituens_lens.html>) and with that, one can peer into the most distant galaxies and every universe in existence
