## Omnituens Lens

`ðŸ“œ Item`

A unique and powerful artifact, forged from an array of rare and precious materials. 

It grants the ability to perceive everything within an immense radius and even provides a weak form of future sight.

When enhanced by the [Omnituens Eye](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/omnituens_eye.html>), its power reaches an unfathomable scale, surpassing conventional limits of observation and foresight.

Due to the immense power it holds, the _Omnituens Lens_ remains in [NAIRO](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/nairo.html>)â€™s possession, while all records detailing its creation have been systematically erasedâ€”burned and deleted to ensure its secrets never fall into the wrong hands.
