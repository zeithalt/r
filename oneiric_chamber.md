## ðŸ’¤ Oneiric Chamber

`ðŸª§ Place` in [A'as Forest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest.html>)

Built on eon 1045 by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>).

Oneiric Chamber is used to induce *Scripted Dreams* and works as a kind of interpreter for scrolls written using Shaushka scripture - a now lost form of mindful rune-writing. This essentially allows the person sleeping in the chamber to live out the memories of others, recorded in these ancient scrolls.

The Chamber itself is a narrow natural room inside a cave system, located under the [Library of Eternal Knowledge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/library_of_eternal_knowledge.html>) and connected to it via an artificial passage. The walls of the chamber are decorated by the intricate runic pattern, carved personally by the [Headmaster Dino](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/curious_dino.html>).

The Chamber has just two pieces of stone "furniture" (if it even can be called so) - a bed-like stone cutout near one of the walls, and a pedestal with a scroll holder next to the other.

Oneiric Chamber is a personal project of _Headmaster Dino_ and part of his studies of Shaushka runes found in the [First Capital Ruins](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/first_capital_ruins.html>), conducted with the goal to restore this ancient form of rune-writing.

The access to the chamber is restricted only to _Headmaster Dino_, but upon its completion he started letting his best students to use it to aid in the studies of Shaushka rune-writing.
