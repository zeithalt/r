A huge skyscraper in the center of the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) capital in [Imperial Swamp](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/imperial_swamp>). Built by [the 3rd President of Zeithalt, T](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/t.html>), as part of fulfilling his election promises. I was supposed to contribute to the complete eradication of bureaucracy in all government structures.

Actually, the official name of this institution is: "Coordinative Center for Administrative-Regulatory Governance and Optimization of State Processes in Honor of T, Third President Zeithalt", abbreviated as: "CCARGO-SP in Honor of T". However, locals simply call it the "Palace of Bureaucracy".

The Palace of Bureaucracy is a place where perfect order, strict hierarchy and endless stacks of documents reign.

The palace is divided into several hundred departments, agencies and divisions responsible for their area of activity. Countless supervisors, their advisers, assistants, secretaries and deputies, who also have their own assistants, secretaries, advisers and deputies.

Such a structure is designed to ensure fast and high-quality decision-making, eliminating any possible bureaucracy at the root.

All employees of the Palace of Bureaucracy are the best specialists who have passed a strict selection. They are excellent at drinking tea, discussing gossip, taking breaks, and also arranging important multi-hour planning meetings and conferences on any occasion to make quick and responsible decisions.

The HR department is working in an emergency mode, not having time to hire new subordinates for the countless number of managers and their deputies.

There are rumors among local residents that the employees of the Palace of Bureaucracy themselves do not know what they do here, but if you ask any employee directly, he will definitely tell you how important his work is and what great efforts he makes to improve the lives of the citizens of Zeithalt and to ensure the ideal work of his department, occupying his position.
