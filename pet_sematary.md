## 🦴 Pet Sematary

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Imperial Swamp](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/imperial_swamp.html>)

Built on eon 915 by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

A quiet, secluded place where those who were more than just pets are laid to rest. Here, every stone, every plaque is a story of love, devotion, and loss. The cemetery is surrounded by trees whose branches whisper comfort to the grieving.

Locals say that at night, you can hear the quiet barking, purring, light chirping of birds, the soft rustling of rodents, or even the barely perceptible splash of water from an aquarium. Sometimes it seems that the shadow of a rabbit flickers in the grass, or the clatter of a horse's hooves.

This is a place not only for memory, but also for comfort - here people find peace, knowing that their beloved pets have found eternal peace.
