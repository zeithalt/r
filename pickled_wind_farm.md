Pickled Wind Farms is a series of 10 wind farms build atop 10 high altitude mountains of Mt. Pickles that are close to eachother and the Energy Hub thats located at the base of the most middle mountain. These farms aim to solve a faction's energy problems via clean and environment friendly methods.

The farms are heavily sponsored by the owner of the local business [Pierre's Porous Pickle Porch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/pppp.html>) (4P), Pierre Porph Pickleson who made this project viable by budget in the first place. It is unknown what deal he got to make this generous sponsorship.

Each farm consists of around 20 large wind turbines which harness clean and renewable energy by converting the kinetic energy of the high speed winds that often occur at these altitudes into electrical energy and a Distribution Hub which are basically small scale Energy Hub's responsible of collecting an individual wind farm's power. The energy is then sent from these Distribution Hubs into the Energy Hub itself, which consists of a control center of the entire operation and storage units, and it is where the energy gets distributed to both into the region and the rest of the faction itself.
