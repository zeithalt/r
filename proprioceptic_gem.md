## ðŸ”¸ Proprioceptic Gems

`ðŸ“œ Item`

Pairs of fine-tuned gems crafted from [Timeless Waystones](timeless_waystone.html) and used by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) in their [ship construction](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/proprioceptic_shipyard.html>).

The ships equipped with these gems give the sea captains ability to know the precise location of their own ship on the island, as well as relative positions of other Proprioceptic Ships in the area.
