## ‚öì Proprioceptic Shipyard

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark` in [Xyrclaox Watch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>)

Built on eon 961 by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

During the research on combining and enhancing the effects of [Timeless Waystones](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_waystone.html>), scientists of the Institute discovered a way to synthesize *Proprioceptic Gems*.

These gems need to be paired together via resonating frequencies. One gem is installed in the ship's hull, while the other is installed in the captain's compass.

The ships equipped with these gems give the sea captains ability to know the precise location of their own ship on the island, as well as relative positions of other _Proprioceptic Ships_ in the area. This allows for effortless navigation in long voyages and the perfect coordination in naval battles.

The shipyard itself is a rather unremarkable set of buildings, hidden away in a harsh winter bay somewhere in [Xyrclaox Watch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>). It relies heavily on the wood materials produced in the nearby [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) and even more so on the steady supply of Proprioceptic Gems coming from [Neuropolis](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/neuropolis.html>) laboratories.
