## Protectores Silva

**ðŸªª Faction**

Formed on [Eon 369](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0369>), Protectores Silva (PS) is the 4th faction established on Zeithalt Island and the first one that was established in the [Age of Battles](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/age_of_battles.html>), on former MT lands.

Synopsis:
> *Zeithalt is rapidly changing under the threats from unnatural disturbances (see [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>)) and dangerous behaviours. To ensure that not only we but also our future generations thrive long-term, we must protect the nature and live in harmony with her.*
