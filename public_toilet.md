## 🚽 Public Toilet

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Dev Null Marsh](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh.html>)

Built on eon 866 by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>).

This building is the pinnacle of architectural art. 

Built from the most expensive materials in Zeithalt this toilet features marble statues, columns, bas-reliefs. 

Inside, everything is also made from the rarest and most expensive materials. For example, all plumbing is made of pure gold of the highest standard, decorated with expensive stones.

With the arrival of [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>), to ensure cleanliness and order, friendly guys of two meters in height with cute clubs in their hands were placed at the entrance so that every visitor could feel safe.

Rumors have it that half of the treasury was spent on the construction of this building. The second half of the treasury was spent when they celebrated the successful completion of the construction.
