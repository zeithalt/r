## 🔭 Ranger Network

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Mt. Pickles](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mt_pickles.html>)

Built on eon 862 by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)

The Ranger Network consists of a series of towering structures, each uniquely designed to blend harmoniously with its natural surroundings. Built atop high cliffs, perched on the edge of a rugged terrain and some even nestled within forests that cover the bases of the mountains, the Ranger Network connects all areas of Mt. Pickles with eachoter thus creating an information network. Which makes rapid response in cases of emergencies easier, helps with the observing and study of the local environment or even simply help lost travellers find their way around.
