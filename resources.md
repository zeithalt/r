## Resources (RES)

**üìë Term**

All lands of Zeithalt Island are rich in resources.

They're divided into 3 broad categories:
- **Science** Resources (SCI)
- **Mineral** Resources (MIN)
- **Energy** Resources (ERG)

Factions have learned to use these resources to their advantage in battles in Special Operations.

There's also a fourth category of resources - [Temporal Resources](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/temporal_resources.html) or (TMP), exclusively found in the [Timeless Desert](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html).
