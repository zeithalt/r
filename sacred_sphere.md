## ðŸª© The Sacred Sphere

`ðŸª§ Place` in [Indigo Shore](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/indigo_shore.html>)

Built on eon 538 by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

A large sphere building made of thick tempered glass and reinforced steel, constructed as a place of worship for all religions, for people worshipping anybody, anything and everything. The Sphere is a big ball of prayer rooms with a rotating shell; The whole structure is made to roll at a barely noticeable slow pace, so it can move between locations and be accessible to all people.

The Sacred Sphere is initially designed to be a universal mobile worshipping facility. With various clerics from all religions, they will provide the pilgrims with everything they need to conduct their respective rituals. Each religion gets its own prayer rooms and is isolated to prevent any disturbing senses (sound, smell, visuals) from going out.

Expanding from the structure's original purpose, it now accepts tourists and travellers from across the land to rest in the middle of their journeys, with the service equalling those of four-star hotels. Recreational facilities are also provided for those who need them, such as a disco stage, a kosher restaurant, a spa and massage area, a playground for kids, and much more.

A series of clever engineering are used to maintain the Sacred Sphere. Its outer shell is constructed using thick tempered glass and reinforced steel for long-lasting durability across various terrains. The internals of the building are equipped with sophisticated gyroscopic stabilizers to keep the entire facility standing upright while the sphere is rolling towards its destination.
