## 🏫 School of Spatial Magic

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Indigo Shore](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/indigo_shore.html>)

The School of Spatial Magic is located somewhere in the rocky area of Indigo Shore. Getting here is a challenging task, because no roads or even paths lead here.

The founder and director of the school, who is also the only teacher, is [T](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/t.html>), the greatest specialist in Spatial Magic, according to T himself, as well as those unfortunates among whom T conducted a survey. It is also worth considering that the interworld community of magicians has appreciated T's abilities in this very complex art. However, we only know this from T's words, and there is a suspicion that the survey was conducted using the same methods as the survey in Zeithalt.

Education at the school is free, but those wishing to enroll must pass difficult entrance exams, because T believes that: "The chance to learn this great art must be earned with sweat and blood."

At the moment, only a few people have been able to enroll, and the remaining hundreds of people who wanted to study ran away from there saying: "I won't study here, he's crazy!", which greatly amused the school director.

The school administration does not name any terms of study or the content of the curriculum. "This is not a comprehensive school, it cannot be unified. First, I need to understand what the student is capable of in general, and then I will create an individual training program for him." — The school director explains with a predatory smile.
