## üç∫ Seven Roads Inn

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark` in [Paradox Pass](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/paradox_pass.html)

Seven Roads is an inn and a tavern in Paradox Pass owned by the [Stonehaver](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/stonehavers) family and currently run by Young Olly Stonehaver.

It sits near the crossroads where a lesser known, but important [Syncrax Road](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/syncrax_road.html) branches off from the famous [Axonite Road](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/axonite_road.html) in a nearly perfect place for a tavern: no matter from which direction the traveler is arriving, as long as they set off at the break of dawn - they would reach the Seven Road Inn shortly before nightfall.

Due to this clever location, the Seven Roads Inn became a preferred resting place for generations of people travelling the [MindTech](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html) lands, and rightfully evokes many warn feelings in the hearts of travelers.
