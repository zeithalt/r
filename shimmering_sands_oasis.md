## Shimmering Sands (oasis)

`ðŸª§ Place`

Shimmering Sands is the biggest and the busiest oasis in the eastern part of [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>), located near the borders with [Oblivion Mire](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html>) and [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>).

Its location and freshwater supplies allowed for it to become a permanent trading post and a resting place for many of the Desert's caravans. This oasis is often used by traders as a hub, the goods from nearby lands are then transported further into the Desert or to the lands beyond the Desert.
