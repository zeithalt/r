## üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Siren's Lighthouse

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark` in [Dev Null Marsh](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh.html>)

Built on eon 509 by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

A tall tower-like structure with a strong light source on top. Situated on a cliff, on the shore of a bay in _Dev Null Marsh_. A place that is the stuff of legends. Half of them are obvious nonsense, but the other half make sense.

This lighthouse was originally built for its obvious purpose - to help captains determine the location of their ships. However, over time, the Sirens have taken a liking to this bay and are using it for their own purposes.

The legend says that no sailor who has heard the angelic singing of a Siren and seen her dazzling beauty can cope with the emotions that overwhelm him. When hypnotized, the sailor jumps into the arms of the Siren, who then drags the poor fellow to the bottom of the sea.

Presumably, with the help of this lighthouse, the Sirens lure ships into the bay, and then, after some time, other sailors find these ships drifting without a crew in the open sea. If the legend is to be believed, one thing is certain: before their disappearance, the sailors were very happy to be near this lighthouse.

Rumor has it that with the arrival of [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) in these lands, the winds of fortune for the Sirens changed. After a very convincing conversation with the Mafia representatives, the Sirens, not wanting to become one of the exotic goods in Brother's Meat Market, promised not to touch the ships of the Mafia-loyal smugglers, who now use this bay as a very secure port for the sea delivery of illegal goods to Zeithalt.
