`ðŸª§ Place` in [Neuropolis](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/neuropolis.html>)

Built by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) on eon 457 during restoration of MT capital soon after [the siege](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0384>).

This project brought the whole districts of [Neuropolis](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/neuropolis.html>) up to the modern standard of infrastructure, greatly increasing the living conditions of lower-class citizens.

However, at the same time it is vastly criticised as a project enforced by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) against [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) will, and even partially aimed at diluting the unique culture of the MindTech capital.
