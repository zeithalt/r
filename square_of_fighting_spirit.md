## üëπ Square of Fighting Spirit

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark` in [Imperial Swamp](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/imperial_swamp.html>)

Built on eon 1175 by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>).

This place of power, surrounded by stone monoliths with unknown inscriptions in the [Deltan language](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltan_language.html>), is located in the center of the Band of Brothers capital. 

The ground here is compacted by the thousands of feet of warriors who have gathered here for many eons to honor the gods of chaos and prepare for battle. 

In the center of the square stands the Altar - a massive stone slab with a red and blue flame burning above it, symbolizing the strength and unity of the Deltans. 

Around the altar stand statues looking towards the center, each of which represents one of the great warriors. All statues hold weapons in their hands, raised aloft.

Before battle, warriors gather in the square, forming strict rows. Their faces are painted with war paint, and in their hands they hold their best weapons. 

The faction leader steps forward and begins a rhythmic battle cry, accompanied by slapping his hands to his chest and stomping his feet. 

The rest of the warriors pick up the rhythm, and in a few moments the ground trembles under their steps, and the air is filled with powerful voices, merging into a single hymn of strength and determination.

This is not just a dance, it is a sacred ritual that awakens the gods of chaos and grants the warriors their blessing. 

Every movement, every gesture is filled with symbolic meaning: from blows that imitate attacks, to wide-open eyes and terrifying grimaces that are supposed to demoralize the enemy. 

When the ritual reaches its climax, the flames on the altar flare up brighter, and the warriors feel their hearts fill with unbridled rage, unity and fighting power.
