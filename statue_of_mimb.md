## 🗽 Statue of Mimb

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Cerene Vale](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cerene_vale.html>)

Built on eon 727 by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)

The _Statue of Mimb_ is a memorial statue created to honor [Mimb](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mimb.html>), one of the most important people in the history of _Protectores_.

One of founders of this faction, great warrior, researcher and politician, her hard work was invaluable in leading [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) through their early eons and in their rise to becoming the fourth great force in Zeithalt, on par with three _Old Factions_.

She had fallen comatose due to overexposure to [Mimps virus](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mimps.html>) on eon 561.

Even though hundreds of eons have passed since, it is believed that she is to this day kept alive by _Silvan_ life support technology.

There is an inscription on base of the statue:

> Mimb  
> CCCXLI -  
> *Etsi mimps eam a nobis abstulit, in cordibus nostris in aeternum vivet. In his spem tenemus ut aliquando evigilet.  
> ~ Protectores Silva*
