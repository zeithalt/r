## T, Cactus Patron

`🧙‍♂️ Character`

Also known as Tsar and Cactus Patron, he often introduces himself by his pseudonym - _T_. An unusual representative of the [Sentient Cactus race](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/sentient_cactus_reservation.html>).

Always appears in public in his Noble Cactus Robe of emerald color (Which, to _T_'s great surprise, turned red due to some red liquid flowing out of his enemies). _T_ also wears a Cactus Crown on his head with spikes that stick out not only outward, but also inward, without causing any inconvenience to its owner.

He built the [Teremok of Cactus Patron](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/teremok_of_cactus_patron.html>) in [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>), where he lives and conducts his secret rituals of Sentient Cactus evolution.

He quickly made acquaintance with key members of the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) and was accepted into their ranks. 

After some time, _T_, together with several other key members of the Delta Collective, created a (presumably) mafia organization [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>). 

Currently, _T_ is one of the leaders of the Band of Brothers, but he himself denies this fact and says that he is an honest and decent citizen.

_T_ absolutely did not bribe anyone to include [this link to his full biography](<https://discord.com/channels/562910943848169472/1340761855186042952/1340761855186042952>).
