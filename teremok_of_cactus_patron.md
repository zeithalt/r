## 🏜️ Teremok of Cactus Patron

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>)

Built on eon 888 by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

It is a modest palace complex of more than ten thousand square meters in size. It is built from an unknown wood material with thorns. Who and where brought the materials for construction, as well as the type of tree itself, is a secret guarded by the [cactus race](sentient_cactus_reservation.html).

It is used as a permanent residence of [T, the Cactus Patron (Patriarch, Tsar)](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/t.html>). The palace complex provides rooms for all representatives of the cactus race. 

This is achieved through the use of spatial magic, distorting and increasing the size of the room.

Representatives of any, NOT cactus race, are strictly prohibited from entering because being inside the complex is dangerous to their lives.
