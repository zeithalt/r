## The Cut (area)

`ðŸª§ Place`

The Cut is a relatively narrow strip of land that serves as a border between the [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>) and [Oblivion Mire](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html>). In this place, the arid and dry winds of the Desert meet the swampy lands of the Mire. As a result, nothing of value grows here - only thorny brambles, wild grass and a few sour berries.

However, some parts of this land (especially the ones closer to [Blue Screen Lagoon](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/blue_screen_lagoon.html>) and [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>)) have occasional springs of fresh water and big rabbit and rodent populations. It makes the Cut suitable for camps of travelers on their way from Mire to the Desert or the other way round.

There's no way to know for sure why the Cut was named this way. The leading theories are for the thorns of its many spiky bushes or for the fact that it quite literally cuts off the Mire from the Desert.
