## 🔲 The Obelisk

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Xyrclaox Watch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch>)

Built on eon 1317 by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute>)

The Obelisk is a colossal monolith of unknown origin that appeared above a remote valley in the _Xyrclaox Watch_ shortly after the [fall of Neuropolis](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1313>).

It hovers silently above the valley, the height of the _Obelisk_ is estimated to be between 600 and 800 meters, with the base being 50 meters wide.

Several times a day, at random intervals the gigantic structure rotates exactly forty-five degrees clockwise at random intervals.

As if the _Obelisk_ has no mass, it turns and stops with no inertia.

Due to its perfectly smooth, mirror-like surface, the _Obelisk_ becomes almost invisible on clear days.

It does not cast any shadow, as if direct sunlight bends around it, however it does reflect the surround landscape and the sky above it.


Clarity of the reflection is so pristine that its top edge has never been observed and the height of the Obelisk can only be estimated.

Known only to locals, there's path leading to the place directly beneath The _Obelisk_, however nothing unusual have been found there yet.
