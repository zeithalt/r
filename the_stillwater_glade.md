## 🌳 Stillwater Glade

`🖼️ Landmark` in [A'as Forest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest>)

Tucked between a dense forest patch and a lazy water stream, in the northern part of _A’as Forest_ lies a quiet opening known as _Stillwater Glade_. For eons, it was a place of no recorded significance - a shaded patch of trickling groundwater, glimmering moss, and pleasant birdsong. Unmapped and unnamed.

But since the [war approached](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1286>) _A’as_ and unrest crept into daily life, _Stillwater Glade_ became a place of quiet pilgrimage. Children were the first to go here, then caretakers, then entire households seeking calm. They said the glade made things _quieter_ not in the ears, but in the head.

The moss absorbs footsteps perfectly. The trees curve overhead in a natural dome, their branches woven to offer a calming shelter.

Now, it has become a place for spontaneous silent gatherings. A place to sit, breathe and... simply be.

In recent weeks, it has become common to say, with soft irony: *“If A’as must fall, let the Stillwater remain.”*
