## ðŸŒ³ Tree of Many Inquiries

**ðŸª§ Place** in [Cybertron Jungle](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybertron_jungle.html>)

The Tree of Many Inquiries (TMI) is a huge oak tree that was discovered by PS in the depths of Cybertron Jungle in Eon 472.

It ages back sometime to at least the Age of Darkness.

Mimb claims the tree then "woke up" from a deep sleep, happy that someone would listen to it.

It is believed that Mimb gets many of her questions from The Tree of Many Inquiries.
