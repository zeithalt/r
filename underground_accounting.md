## üìöÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è Underground Accounting

`üñºÔ∏è Landmark` in [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity>)

Built on eon 1198 by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers>)

Where does the Mafia keep its secrets? That's right, away from its own business, as well as from prying eyes and ears!

This is a complex of offices scattered throughout the city, which are the repository of all the secrets, contracts, financial reports and other documents of the Mafia, which must be reliably hidden from prying eyes.

The accounting offices are located somewhere in Admincity. However, for security reasons, even the [Capos of Mafia](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/capos_of_mafia.html>) do not know the exact location, and the rest of the employees working in one office do not know the location of other offices.

All accounting employees are the best specialists, who have passed a strict selection. They have impeccable skills in their field, and are also absolutely devoted to the Mafia.

The Mafia accounting office is one of the most secure places in Zeithalt. Each employee understands that the security of the entire organization depends on their actions. There is no room for mistakes here, security personnel immediately intercept any suspicious behavior.

At the entrance to the office, you will find an ordinary, unremarkable door without a sign. However, behind it, you will find such a strong and complex security system that you may think that you are in front of a bank vault. Also, all the windows in the office are fake. From the outside it is a window, and from the inside it is a wall, which eliminates the possibility of spying on what is happening inside.

In case of detection and an attempt to forcibly seize the office, a special protocol has been developed, according to which, during the storming of the entrance safe doors, all available documentation is destroyed, and all employees are ~~killed~~ urgently evacuated through a secret back entrance with the help of security service.

The accounting staff lives in an atmosphere of constant tension, but at the same time they are proud of their highly paid job and belonging to a huge mechanism that works for one purpose: maintaining the power and influence of the [Mafia](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>).
