## 🦈 Void Shark Hatchery

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Dev Null Marsh](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh.html>)

Built on eon 554 by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

Essentially, an abandoned building on the seashore in Dev Null Marsh.

According to rumors, it was planned to breed Void Sharks here, which were then supposed to receive internal cybernetic implants. 

However, for unknown reasons, the creators did not get around to the final implementation of this idea, and the project was abandoned, and all the equipment was taken away.

At the moment, this building is a reminder to all residents of Zeithalt, and especially those in power, that they must be more responsible in their projects. 

Especially such expensive ones, and not throw huge amounts of money down the drain for the sake of not entirely clear ideas that will ultimately not be fully implemented.
