## Watchtower Ruins

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Xyrclaox Watch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>)

Ruins of the very same watchtower that game the land its name. It once stood strong and overlooked the shores of Xyclaox Watch, hosting a watch guard to ward against any potential thread from the sea.

Rumors say that at the time of construction it was the tallest structure on the whole island.

The exact reason of its fall is lost in history, with versions ranging from it being destroyed in a battle, or as a result of one of the [CR Outbursts](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>).

Ruins reconstructed by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) into a tourist attraction on eon 737.
