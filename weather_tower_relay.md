## 🎏 Weather Tower Relay

`🖼️ Landmark` in [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>)

Built on eon 586 by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

Located at the north-eastern part of [Synaxos](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>), the Weather Relay Tower, known locally as *Stormwarden*, was built to aid and predict the annual *Nordostvent* or northeastern winds that brings large storms and cyclones on its shores. It was also built as a natural power source by harnessing the strong winds and storm energy of the surrounding areas.

The tower is made of steel and an alloy of aluminum, silver, and aetrun on major parts, especially the energy storage and the machinery used to collect it. The mass towers around 277 meters with metallic branches sprouting every twenty-three meters on each side and large windmill-like blades at the end of each collecting wind and storm energies.

The collected energy is used to deflect oncoming storms or weaken them, and to power the nearby *Sostrom School of Icelese* whose research helped create the tower itself. Its current headmaster is Atlatis Enderum Anemo Sostrom the Fourth, and the institute's leading Meteoromancer.
